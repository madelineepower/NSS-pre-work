    <h2 class="subtitle">Come see everything Carmel has to offer.</h2>
    <ul class="attractions">
      <li>An <span class="emphasized">Arts & Design District</span> spans several city blocks and includes art galleries, restaurants and shops, along with the <span class="emphasized">Indiana Design Center</span>. The area continues to evolve within the oldest part of the city, which had been in decline for many years.</li>
      <br>
      <li>A beautiful <span class="emphasized">Center for the Performing Arts</span> with the world-class, 1,600-seat Palladium concert hall; two separate theaters; and the home of Grammy Award winning performer Michael Feinstein and his Great American Songbook Initiative.</li>
      <br>
      <li>A comprehensive system of multi-use trails, miles of dedicated bicycle lanes on city streets and more than 500 acres of park land – including the <span class="emphasized">Monon Community Center</span> with its outdoor water park that attracts thousands of visitors from across the state.</li>
      <br>
      <li>More than 80 roundabouts – the most of any city in America – have replaced many traffic signals and 4-way stops throughout the community, making Carmel one of the most commuter-friendly cities in America. Roundabouts have become highly regarded by federal highway safety officials and have become a preferred option for cities across America because roundabouts greatly reduce the number of accidents with injury.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The development of several high-density employment centers – including Indiana’s second highest concentration of office workers – the U.S. 31corridor – has helped Carmel attract more than 40 corporate headquarters of major companies that do business worldwide. Most recently, in 2013, GEICO established its first major corporate center in Indiana in Carmel; NextGear Capital opened a new headquarters and made plans to expand its workforce; Baldwin & Lyons, Inc. relocated its headquarters to Carmel; and American Specialty Health announced plans to move its corporate headquarters from San Diego, CA, to Carmel. These announcements will increase Carmel’s workforce six percent during the next five years.</li>
